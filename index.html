            <h2>Holidaze</h2>
            <p>
              Holidaze is a project made in context of the final exam at Noroff
              School of technology and digital media. The project is made with
              React.js and uses Wordpress for handling the backend of the
              project. The website is a hotel booking site located in Bergen
              Norway. Users can browse the website for different accommodations
              and make bookings for them. There is also a contact page for the
              user to send a message. If you log in with the correct username
              and password on the log in page, you get access to the admin
              section. Here you can add new accommodations. The messages added
              from the contact page and the enquiries from the bookings are also
              listed here to read through.

            <h2>Sneakers Heaven</h2>
            <p>
              Sneakers Heaven is an e-commerce website selling sneakers. The
              project is made using regular JavaScript and uses a local version
              of Strapi to handel the backend. The user can search different
              products on the product page or look at the featured products on
              the index page. Each product has an add to cart button that puts
              this product in the cart page using local storage. The cart page
              displays all products in the cart with a total price. You can
              remove products by clicking the trash can button on each product.
              The website also has a contact page and a log in page that
              redirects you to the admin section if you log in with the correct
              user credentials. In the admin section you can add new products,
              edit and delete existing products.

            <h2>JavaScript Frameworks CA</h2>
            <p>
              This is a project built with Next.js. The main section uses a
              public API to display results from different breweries. the
              breweries are displayed on the index page and if you click them
              you get to a brewery detail page of this brewery. The project also
              has a contact page with form validation using hookform resolver
              and yup. There is also a log in page where a local instalation of
              Wordpress using the JWT Auth plugin is used to handle the backend.
              If you type in the correct username and password in the form and
              log in you will be redirected to an empty admin page.
